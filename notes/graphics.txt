Techniques I need to try:
- if, in a vertex shader, you respace the geo normal / light normal dot product so that light can wrap around an object more, what kind of look can be achieved?
- references something called "deep compositing", using pixel depth for something I'm not quite understanding: (back up a little bit) https://youtu.be/8H73qv1gMNA?si=ML2GvnipK5-7f7J0&t=570
- short convo / reference explosions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-zfvs9WnSs
