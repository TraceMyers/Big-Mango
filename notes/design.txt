- one powerful movement upgrade that can be chosen (exclusively a la Deus Ex) : the jump upgrade. i'm open to something more exciting coming along, but this is alright: basically, a two-step jump. the first step puts you up in the air where you have a vantage point to plan your landing (a small amount of slow motion. not super-slow.), then with the aid of a circle being projected onto your target landing place in order to show both location and communicate the surface normal (provides simple visual queue to quickly know what you can land on), you decide where to try to land (within range). there is still some air control and potential for failure in the execution despite whatever decisions are made (unlike Talos Principle). I'm imagining taking the feel and motion of launching in Gravity Rush and combining it with the decisionmaking power when jumping in Talos Principle.
