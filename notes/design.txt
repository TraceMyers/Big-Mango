- one powerful movement upgrade that can be chosen (exclusively a la Deus Ex) : the jump upgrade. i'm open to something more exciting coming along, but this is alright: basically, a two-step jump. the first step puts you up in the air where you have a vantage point to plan your landing (a small amount of slow motion. not super-slow.), then with the aid of a circle being projected onto your target landing place in order to show both location and communicate the surface normal (provides simple visual queue to quickly know what you can land on), you decide where to try to land (within range). there is still some air control and potential for failure in the execution despite whatever decisions are made (unlike Talos Principle). I'm imagining taking the feel and motion of launching in Gravity Rush and combining it with the decisionmaking power when jumping in Talos Principle.
- a lot of games flirt with or use sustained disempowerment without becoming frustrating. Horror games, in particular, come to mind. how to use that? would it be interesting to play more with disempowerment later on, after players are already invested? not just performatively, but truly. One example that was pretty interesting was Lisa The Painful, where your party members die permanently and Brad can choose to sacrifice his limbs one at a time in order to remain morally in the right, in his mind.
    - decisions players make where they can chose disempowerment or (break character / stray from a goal / perform atrocity) *can* feel like real agency.
- hacking = late 90's to early 2000's aesthetic hollywood hacker bullshit mixed with a fun arcade game experience. whatever flying through the internet is supposed to look like. I would like to pull in some of what I imagined from the Sprawl trilogy. I imagined some pretty amazing internet visuals from that.
- borrowing the grungy supercity aesthetic for irl would be a trip, but how could I make it doable by one person?
I guess I know AI pretty well so maybe I could get it in place pretty quickly? but, the playable areas still can't be that big, so it would have to suggest size more than being an actually large playable city.
- the two aesthetics (punchy over-saturated internet) and the dim, grungy world might make for an interesting contrast.
- probably need to have small scale for hacking. prob just one minigame. it can't suck if you have to do it, but I'd rather you never have to... I know deus ex (original) didn't do this and is maybe better for it. something to think about. I guess if it's a real arcade game, it's worth doing. if not, it's not.
