- one powerful movement upgrade that can be chosen (exclusively a la Deus Ex) : the jump upgrade. i'm open to something more exciting coming along, but this is alright: basically, a two-step jump. the first step puts you up in the air where you have a vantage point to plan your landing (a small amount of slow motion. not super-slow.), then with the aid of a circle being projected onto your target landing place in order to show both location and communicate the surface normal (provides simple visual queue to quickly know what you can land on), you decide where to try to land (within range). there is still some air control and potential for failure in the execution despite whatever decisions are made (unlike Talos Principle). I'm imagining taking the feel and motion of launching in Gravity Rush and combining it with the decisionmaking power when jumping in Talos Principle.
- a lot of games flirt with or use sustained disempowerment without becoming frustrating. Horror games, in particular, come to mind. how to use that? would it be interesting to play more with disempowerment later on, after players are already invested? not just performatively, but truly. One example that was pretty interesting was Lisa The Painful, where your party members die permanently and Brad can choose to sacrifice his limbs one at a time in order to remain morally in the right, in his mind.
    - decisions players make where they can chose disempowerment or (break character / stray from a goal / perform atrocity) *can* feel like real agency.
